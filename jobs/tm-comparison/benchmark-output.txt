=========
In this release we compare ourselves against four other leading open source competitor products with a view to checking that the release remains competitive. Results are produced using JMH (a micro benchmark harness created by the OpenJDK project team available from http://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jmh/). 

We have attempted to configure each product on an equal footing by choosing sensible defaults for each tunable parameter and by ensuring that recovery is enabled, although we do configure narayana with the journal store, which is our best performing transaction log storage mechanism. If you have any recommendations for other transaction managers or how to tune the configuration then please let us know so that we can update our test job. 

The benchmark runs a transaction containing two dummy resources.

We will let the figures speak for themselves, suffice to say that when more and more threads are thrown at the workload we scale better showing that we have excellent control over parallelism. The actual figures are: 

Threads           A           B           C           D    Narayana
      1        2423       10626        4984           9        3928
     24        3107       12010      160700       16239       91510
    240        2521       11751      240449       16943      182289
   1600        2529       11192      178163       17972      154283
