=========
In this release we compare ourselves against four other leading open source competitor products with a view to checking that the release remains competitive. Results are produced using JMH (a micro benchmark harness created by the OpenJDK project team available from http://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jmh/). 

We have attempted to configure each product on an equal footing by choosing sensible defaults for each tunable parameter and by ensuring that recovery is enabled, although we do configure narayana with the journal store, which is our best performing transaction log storage mechanism. If you have any recommendations for other transaction managers or how to tune the configuration then please let us know so that we can update our test job. 

The benchmark runs a transaction containing two dummy resources.

We will let the figures speak for themselves, suffice to say that when more and more threads are thrown at the workload we scale better showing that we have excellent control over parallelism. The actual figures are: 

Threads           A           B           C           D    Narayana
      1        1136        1349        1274           9         200
     10        1099        2645        7303        6689        1983
     50        1060        2685       33220       15375        9721
    300         941        2522       31808       16357       47460
